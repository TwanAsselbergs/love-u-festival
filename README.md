## Overview

Love U Festival is an individual school project for a fictional company, named Love U. For this project we got the task to build a Progressive Web Application (PWA) for their festival-goers.

1. Front-end (`/index.html`)

   - A user-friendly application designed for customers to browse products and place orders.
   - Provides a seamless ordering experience on a touchscreen or kiosk.

2. API (`/server`)

   - Supplies product data to the front-end.
   - Handles incoming orders by storing them in the database.
   - Uses WebSockets to broadcast new orders to the dashboard in real time.

3. Back-end (`/dashboard`)

   - A dashboard accessible only to employees.
   - Displays incoming orders and relevant statistics for order management.
